1. 3, because prices is of length 3.
2. 150, because that is the discounted price for 300.
3. 150, because that is the final price after the discount of 300.
4. Nothing, because we didn't console log the results of the function return!
5. Error, because the variable i is not valid after the for loop since its outside the block.
6. Error, because the variable discountedPrice is not valid outside of the for-loop block.
7. 150, because the variable is still valid since the console log is within the block.
8. Nothing, because we didn't console log the results of the function return.
9. Error, because the variable i is not valid outside of the for-loop block.
10. 3, because that is the length of the array and is within the block of the console log.
11. Nothing because we did not output the function return.
12 a) console.log(Object.values(student)[0]) 
    b) console.log(Object.values(student)[2])
    c) student.greeting()
    d) console.log(Object.values(student)[4]["name"])
    e) console.log(Object.values(student)[5][0])

13 a) '32' - string concat
    b) 1 - normal substraction
    c) 3 - 3 plus nothing is 3
    d) '3null' - 3 concat null
    e) 4 - 1 + 3
    f) 0 - 0 + nothing = 0
    g) '3undefined' - 3 concat
    h) NaN - anything minus undefined is undefined

14  a) true - char value is greater
    b) false - only compares the first char
    c) true - string 2 becomes int 2
    d) false - string 2 stays string 2 b/c of 3rd '='
    e) false - b/c true is 1
    f) true - b/c anything not 0 is true

15. == compares the values based on a normal comparison, for example '1' will be 1 compares to another
    1, meanwhile === will keep the types the same. For example, '1' will stay '1'.

16. Inside a separate js file.
17. Nothing is returned. This is because there is no correct input to any of the functions in this 
stack. doSomething requires a num parameter which is not empty. Meanwhile, modifyArray requires a 
callBack array but doSomething is not that.
